One is the global land temperature data obtained from Berkley Earth - an independent non-profit organization focused on environmental data science. The study, which the data is from, is entirely transparent. With this dataset, we are able to analyze the temperature data by time classified by geographical location.  The other dataset is the carbon dioxide emission data obtained from Our World in Data, a non-profit organization focus on global problems. We believe the data presented by both these two sources are credible and eligible for this project."),
