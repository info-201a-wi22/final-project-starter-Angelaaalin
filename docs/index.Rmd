## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

### Summary information

This script shows several values that we analyzed from our data. We found that the global average temperature change from the 18th century to the 19th century is -0.1939273, from the 19th century to the 20th century is 0.6286067, and from the 20th century to the 21st century is 0.9043821. We also found that the average temperature of countries after 2000 is 19.51453, the entity with the highest CO2 emission is Asia, the city with the highest average temperature in the most recent year in the dataset is Umm Durman. The state with the highest average temperature in the 21st century is Puducherry, India.

### us average temperature and co2 emission from 1990 to 2010
This table shows the average temperature of US and its co2 emission from 1990 to 2010. From this table, we found that from 1990 to 2010 the average temperature in US was increasing, and the carbon emission was also increasing at the same time.

### global temperature and emissions overview
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source("../source/Global_temperature_Overview.R")
show_global_temp()
```
The purpose of this chart is to give an overview of changing of the global temperature from 1750 to 2015. each point represents the mean global temperature of the year. Some land average temperature data are missing before age 1754; thus, the observations before 1754 were removed. The ocean temperature data was not recorded until approximately 1850. The early land average temperature data were widely spread; however, the more recent data of both land and land-ocean data show a strong positive correlation with time. It may imply that the global temperature has been increasing over the past centuries. 

### global CO2 emissions overview
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source("../source/CO_Emissions_Overview.R")
show_global_CO2_emission()
```
This chart shows the change in total global carbon dioxide emissions with respect to the year. This chart is intended to help answer the first research question, "is climate change caused by humans?" The chart shows a surge in global CO2 emission in the twentieth century. 

### average temperature in the U.S overview
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source("../source/U.S_Temperature_Overview.R")
map
```
This is a choropleth map of average temperature of the U.S by state. This chart shows the difference of average temperature in each state of the U.S. This intend to help people have a overview about the average temperature in America and find the reason why different places will have different temperature like development or population.
