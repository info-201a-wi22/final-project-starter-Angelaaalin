## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

### us average temperature and co2 emission from 1990 to 2010
This table shows the average temperature of US and its co2 emission from 1990 to 2010. From this table, we found that from 1990 to 2010 the average temperature in US was increasing, and the carbon emission was also increasing at the same time.
```{r table source, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source("../source/Aggregate Table Script.R")

us_temp_co2
```


### global temperature and emissions overview
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source("../source/Global_temperature_Overview.R")

show_global_temp()

```

### global CO2 emissions overview
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source("../source/CO_Emissions_Overview.R")
show_global_CO2_emission()
```
